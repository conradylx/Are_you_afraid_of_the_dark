# Are_you_afraid_of_the_dark

A project that checks speed of
learning new technology. The implementation time is 2 business  days to learn the basics of the Scala language 
and implement a solution consisting in decomposing the image into 3 separate channels (red, green and blue) 
in order to analyze the darkness of the input image, calculate the darkness percentage, set new name of the 
file and place it in the correct folder depending of result. Additionally, in a separate file there is a treshold configuration file.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following installed:
- Scala 3
- Scala sbt
- Java

## How it works?
You need change the path of images input and output folders, because the assumption is that the folders will be permanent, so 
I won't implement this functionality of change directories in configuration file, at the moment, but it's possible.

Feel free to ask me!
